This particular repository it's just to have fun.
These are quick little proyects begginners can do to learn some clean writing coding, also
some logic & functions.
I'll try to expand this repository with consistent growing difficulty and larger scales of codes.
That being said, don't expect anything actually BIG or some amazing program to be found here, I expect 
those to be in a repository of their own, in due time.
