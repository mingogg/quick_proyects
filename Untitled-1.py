#   PICK A NUMBER!
#  This time YOU pick a number and the program has to 
# guess what number you're thinking by making you questions.
#  You have to indicate if the number is higher by answering "mayor", or
# if it's lower by answering "minor", or if it is correct by answering "correct".
#  Be careful, if you answer anything else it will know, and if maaybe if you're
# not playing by the rules it might expose you. :)

# Before playin/reading, try to do it yourself.
